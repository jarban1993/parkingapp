# parkingapp
Application that is used to store a parking spot's credentials and then navigate the user back to that spot.

The project is an innovative approach to navigation as it stores every possible aspect of the parking spot for maximum accuracy for the user to navigate to the exact location and at the correct time. No other application does this and should prove to be efficient for users in cities or large parking complexes to keep track of their car's location.
