Proposal
If you have ever been in the city or a large parking lot when it is extremely busy you know the struggles of trying to find your car after you park it. I propose a mobile application that can be used to pinpoint your vehicle after it is parked and then be navigated to when requested. This application would also have additional functionality of putting in a parking space number, if one is provided, and also a meter countdown if it is timed parking. If the meter is running low the application will notify the user based on a predetermined time either from the userâ€™s specifications or will give automatic suggestion based on distance from the vehicle. Also if in a parking garage the ability to specify the floor that you parked on. I have never heard of any application like this where it is able to give you every option to find your car by different categories and give a map direction of where to go.
